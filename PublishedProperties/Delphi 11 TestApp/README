There are two demo projects, a Delphi 10 and Delphi 11 project.

The Delphi 10 project will work on Delphi 10, it doesn't use MyCustomForm or
anything from the package. It will break on Delphi 11, so it isn't part of the
Demos project group. This is because Opening it in D11 will automatically try
to update it.

The Delphi 11 project will work on Delphi 11 with the package installed.
