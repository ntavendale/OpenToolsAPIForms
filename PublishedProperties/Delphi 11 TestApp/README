There are two demo projects, a Delphi 10 and Delphi 11 project.

The Delphi 10 project will work on Delphi 10, it doesn't use MyCustomForm or
anything from the package. It should break on Delphi 11, meaning OldCreateOrder
will stop working.

The Delphi 11 project will work on Delphi 11 with the package installed and restore
the OldCreateOrder behaviour.
