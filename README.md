# OpenToolsAPIForms
Will add a form in the File->New->Other Gallery under thee Delphi->New. Developed with Delphi 10 (Tokyo) but should work with at least Version 10.2, and possibly older versions, as well.
Any version where ToolsInf.pas and EditIntf.pas are *not* deprecated probably won't work. You'll have to check those files on your version. I only have 10.2 & 11 installed here.
