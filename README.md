# OpenToolsAPIForms
Will add a form in the Fie->New->Other Gallery under it's own category: Windows -> Our Custom Forms. Developed with Delphi 11 (Alexandria) but sghould work with at least Version 10.2, and possibly older versions, as well.
Any version where ToolsInf.pas and EditIntf.pas are *not* deprecated provbbably won't work.
